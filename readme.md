# Simple implementation of a spinning cube in go, might expand it to more geometry in the future but for now it's just a lil cube
- First Time using Golang, was kinda fun, felt a bit different
- used other repos for reference to try and get an idea of how this works, this is in no way an original idea learned
    - namely this one:

# TODO
    [ ] LOD implementation
    [ ] look into offloading the computation for rendering to the GPU
    [ ] STL Parsing
    [ ] For the sphere/logic that will be extended for other shapes implement aspect ratio calculation based on given terminal dimensions right now I just guesstimate
